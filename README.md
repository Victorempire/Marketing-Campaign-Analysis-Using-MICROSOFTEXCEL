# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis-Using-MICROSOFTEXCEL
# Introduction
BrandBoost Inc. manages multiple digital marketing campaigns across different regions, customer segments, 
channels, and campaign types. As clients increasingly demand accountability for marketing spend,
there is a growing need to understand which campaigns generate value and which lead to wasted budget. 
This project analyzes historical campaign data using a Power BI dashboard to evaluate performance and support data-driven marketing decisions.
# Objectives
The objectives of this analysis are to identify key drivers of high ROI and low Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC),
compare performance across channels, audiences, customer segments, campaign types, duration, and location, detect patterns linked to engagement and conversions,
reduce inefficient marketing spend, and provide actionable insights for campaign optimization.
# Hypothesis
The Analysis is based on the following assumptions:
- The analysis assumes that campaigns with higher engagement scores achieve better conversion and ROI
- Targeted campaigns outperform broad audience campaigns, some channels and campaign types consistently deliver better ROI
- longer campaign duration does not always improve performance, and a small number of campaigns generate a large share of revenue.
# Problem Statement
Despite high marketing investment, BrandBoost Inc. lacks clarity on which campaign combinations drive the highest ROI,
why some campaigns have high acquisition costs but low conversions, and how to identify underperforming campaigns early.
This project addresses these gaps by transforming raw data into clear, quantifiable insights.
## Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Analysis
Data preparation was performed using Power Query. Numeric fields such as impressions, clicks, acquisition cost, conversions,
and engagement scores were assigned correct data types. Column names were standardized for consistency, 
and invalid records were removed. Key performance indicators such as impressions, clicks, conversions, CAC, 
and ROI were calculated using DAX to enable dynamic analysis.

# Overall Performance
The dashboard shows 44,557,842 total impressions,
4,405,030 clicks, 3,562,712 conversions, 
total acquisition cost of $2.5 billion,
and overall ROI of 497%. 
This indicates strong overall performance but also highlights the need to focus spending on the most efficient campaigns.
